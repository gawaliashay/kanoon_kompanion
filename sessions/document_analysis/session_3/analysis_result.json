    "summary": "This summary concerns the sale deeds of two separate commercial and residential properties in New Delhi. In both cases, the sellers, Mr. Sanjay Gupta and Mr. Rajesh Sharma, respectively, transfer ownership of the properties to the buyers, Mr. Rohit Mehta and Ms. Ananya Verma, for a specified sum of money. The key legal principle at play is the transfer of property ownership, which is subject to the Transfer of Property Act of 1882. The sellers guarantee that the properties are free from encumbrances, mortgages, or litigation, and the buyers accept the properties in their current condition. Ownership transfer occurs upon registration and full payment. The legal obligations and rights of the parties are defined by their agreement, which is executed in the presence of witnesses."
