    "question": "what is embedding ?",
    "answer": "In the context provided, an embedding refers to a way of representing data, such as words or tokens, in a numerical format that can be processed by machine learning models. This is often necessary because models like the Transformer work with numerical data, and embeddings allow for the conversion of discrete data like words into continuous vectors. The embeddings have the same dimension as the positional encodings, so that the two can be summed.",
