    "summary": "Document 1245/2 discusses the results of a study on the impact of a new software tool on employee productivity. The tool was implemented in a test group of 150 employees, resulting in a 20% increase in productivity on average. The control group of 150 employees, who did not receive the new tool, saw no change in productivity. The study also found that employees who used the new tool reported higher job satisfaction. The decision was made to implement the new software tool for all employees due to the significant productivity improvement and positive employee feedback."
